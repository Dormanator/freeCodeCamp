## Algorithm Challenges
Check out the solutions I developed for the basic, intermediate, and advanced algorithm challenges I completed while working towards freeCodeCamp's Front-End Development certificate.

## Intermediate Projects
### Front-End API Integration
* Random Quote Generator
* Local Weather
* Wikipedia Viewer
* Twitch.tv Status

All intermediate projects listed above were compiled into the Intermediate Project Site, which can be found [here](https://dormanator.github.io/freeCodeCamp/).

For each project, I aimed to use a different method for my AJAX API calls (e.g., JSONP, jQuery, promises, & async/await). 

I still enjoy my design of the intermediate projects, and their functionality speaks to my ability to integrate API's on the front-end. However, these projects are from an era before I understood how to use objects to create modules in my code, and before I knew how to bundle files. As a result, the code organization of the intermediate projects and the project site that hosts them leaves much to be desired, but I left these inefficiencies untouched because it helps show the improvements I made in these areas as I moved into the advanced projects.

## Advanced Projects
### Front-End JavaScript Challenges
