## Intermediate Projects
### Front-End API Integration
* Random Quote Generator
* Local Weather
* Wikipedia Viewer
* Twitch.tv Status

All intermediate projects listed above were compiled into the Intermediate Project Site, which can be found [here](https://dormanator.github.io/freeCodeCamp/).

For each project, I aimed to use a different method for my AJAX API calls (e.g., JSONP, jQuery, promises, & async/await).
