## Algorithm Challenges
Check out the solutions I developed for the basic, intermediate, and advanced algorithm challenges I completed while working towards freeCodeCamps Front-End Development certificate.

## Intermediate Projects
### Front-End API Intergration

All intermediate projects listed above were compiled into the Intermediate Project Site, which can be found [here](https://freecodecamp.ryandorman.tech).

I still enjoy the design of the intermediate projects, and their functionality speaks to my ability to integrate API's on the front-end. For each project I aimed to use a different method for my API calls (e.g., jsonp, jQuery, promises, & aync/await). 

However, these projects are from an era before I understood how to use OOP design to organize and modularize my code, and before I knew how to use webpack to harness ES6 import features across browsers. As a result, the code organization of the intermediate projects leaves much to be desired, but also helps show the improvements I made in these areas as I moved into the advanced projects.

## Advanced Projects
